# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Stock Prices
This is a data analysis project that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of stock prices. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the patterns and trends in the stock prices over time, as well as identify any potential relationships or correlations between different stocks.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Yahoo Finance stock prices dataset, which consists of daily stock prices for several major companies over a period of several years. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in this project.

# Code
The code for this project is written in Python 3 and is contained in the EDA of Stock prices.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook uses several popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The notebook is divided into several sections, including data loading and preprocessing, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Each section includes detailed explanations of the code and its functionality.

# Results
The results of the EDA are presented in the notebook using various types of visualizations, such as line plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. These visualizations allow for exploration of the stock prices and their relationships in a user-friendly way.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of EDA techniques to gain insights into a dataset of stock prices. The code and results can be easily replicated or modified for use in other stock analysis projects.
